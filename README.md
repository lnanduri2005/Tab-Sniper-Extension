# Tab Sniper

**A productivity browser extension that blocks distracting websites during focus sessions**

## üìã Overview

Tab Sniper is a Chrome extension designed to help you stay focused by blocking distracting websites for a set period. The extension features a unique "focus mode" that makes it challenging to disable once activated, with a playable cannon game that requires skill to overcome.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Website Blocking**: Add any distracting websites to your block list
- **Timed Focus Sessions**: Set a timer for your focus session (in minutes)
- **Hidden URL List**: During focus sessions, your block list is hidden to reduce temptation
- **Game Challenge**: The only way to disable focus mode early is to win a skill-based cannon game
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Clean, dark-themed UI for a distraction-free experience

## üéÆ The Challenge Game

When focus mode is active and you try to remove a blocked URL, you'll be presented with a cannon game:
- Aim and shoot the cannon to get the ball into the moving bucket
- Score 3 points to disable focus mode and unlock all websites
- Limited to 3 shots maximum per attempt
- Adjustable difficulty with moving targets and physics

## üöÄ How It Works

1. **Add Websites**: Enter URLs you want to block during focus time
2. **Set Timer**: Choose how long you want to stay focused (in minutes)
3. **Start Focus Mode**: Activate the timer to begin blocking the specified websites
4. **Stay Focused**: Any attempt to visit blocked sites will be automatically prevented
5. **Emergency Override**: If you absolutely need to access a site, win the cannon game

### During Focus Mode

### Ending Focus Mode
