# Tab Sniper

**A productivity browser extension that blocks distracting websites during focus sessions**

## 📋 Overview

Tab Sniper is a Chrome extension designed to help you stay focused by blocking distracting websites for a set period. The extension features a unique "focus mode" that makes it challenging to disable once activated, with a playable cannon game that requires skill to overcome.

## ✨ Features

- **Website Blocking**: Add any distracting websites to your block list
- **Timed Focus Sessions**: Set a timer for your focus session (in minutes)
- **Hidden URL List**: During focus sessions, your block list is hidden to reduce temptation
- **Game Challenge**: The only way to disable focus mode early is to win a skill-based cannon game
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Clean, dark-themed UI for a distraction-free experience

## 🎮 The Challenge Game

When focus mode is active and you try to remove a blocked URL, you'll be presented with a cannon game:
- Aim and shoot the cannon to get the ball into the moving bucket
- Score 3 points to disable focus mode and unlock all websites
- Limited to 3 shots maximum per attempt
- Adjustable difficulty with moving targets and physics

## 🚀 How It Works

1. **Add Websites**: Enter URLs you want to block during focus time
2. **Set Timer**: Choose how long you want to stay focused (in minutes)
3. **Start Focus Mode**: Activate the timer to begin blocking the specified websites
4. **Stay Focused**: Any attempt to visit blocked sites will be automatically prevented
5. **Emergency Override**: If you absolutely need to access a site, win the cannon game

## 🔧 Usage

### Setting Up Focus Mode
1. Toggle the extension on using the switch at the top
2. Add distracting websites to your block list (e.g., facebook.com, twitter.com)
3. Set the timer duration in minutes
4. Click "Start Focus Timer" to begin your focused work session

### During Focus Mode
- The extension will block any attempt to visit your listed websites
- The URL list is hidden (can be temporarily revealed)
- The timer will count down showing your remaining focus time

### Ending Focus Mode
- Wait for the timer to expire naturally
- OR play the cannon game by clicking the remove button (❌) next to any URL
- Win the game by getting the ball in the bucket 3 times with a maximum of 3 shots
