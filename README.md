# Tab Sniper

**A productivity browser extension that blocks distracting websites during focus sessions**

## 📋 Overview

Tab Sniper is a Chrome extension designed to help you stay focused by blocking distracting websites for a set period. The extension features a unique "focus mode" that makes it challenging to disable once activated, with a playable cannon game that requires skill to overcome.

## ✨ Features

- **Website Blocking**: Add any distracting websites to your block list
- **Timed Focus Sessions**: Set a timer for your focus session (in minutes)
- **Hidden URL List**: During focus sessions, your block list is hidden to reduce temptation
- **Game Challenge**: The only way to disable focus mode early is to win a skill-based cannon game
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Clean, dark-themed UI for a distraction-free experience

## 🚀 How It Works

1. **Add Websites**: Enter URLs you want to block during focus time
2. **Set Timer**: Choose how long you want to stay focused (in minutes)
3. **Start Focus Mode**: Activate the timer to begin blocking the specified websites
4. **Stay Focused**: Any attempt to visit blocked sites will be automatically prevented

## 🔧 Usage

### During Focus Mode

### Ending Focus Mode
